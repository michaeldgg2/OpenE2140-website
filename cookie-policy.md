# Cookie Policy

This site uses a minimal set of cookies to remember your cookie choices and to control whether analytics are loaded. We care about your privacy: our analytics provider (Umami) is a privacy-focused, cookie-less analytics platform.

## Cookies we use

We use two simple cookies to manage the cookie banner and your consent choice:

| Cookie name | Value | Purpose | Type & Duration |
|-------------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `showCookieBanner` | `true` or `false` | Controls whether the cookie banner (consent prompt) is shown. Set to `false` after you dismiss the banner so it isn't shown repeatedly. | Functional — 365 days |
| `cookiesAccepted` | `true` or `false` | Records whether you accepted cookies. If `true`, the site will load our analytics script (Umami). If `false`, analytics will not be loaded. | Preference — 365 days |

**Note:** The `cookiesAccepted` cookie itself is used only to remember your choice and is not used for tracking.

## About our analytics (Umami)

We use Umami for site analytics. Umami is a privacy-friendly, cookie-less analytics platform that does not store personal data or set tracking cookies by default. Even though Umami is cookie-less, we honor your choice: we only load the Umami script when your `cookiesAccepted` cookie is set to `true`.

## How to change or revoke your consent

You can change or revoke your cookie consent at any time by clearing the `cookiesAccepted` and `showCookieBanner` cookies in your browser.

If you clear or remove the stored preferences, the cookie banner may be shown again so you can reselect your preference.
